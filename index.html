            <h2><span># </span>Versioning Scheme</h2>
            <p>Laravel and its other first-party packages follow Semantic Versioning. Major framework releases are released every year 
                (~February), while minor and patch releases may be released as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should never 
                contain breaking changes.
            </p>
            <p>When referencing the Laravel framework or its components from your application or package, you should always use a version 
                constraint such as <span class="code">^9.0</span>, since major releases of Laravel do include breaking changes. However, we strive to always ensure 
                you may update to a new major release in one day or less.
            </p>
            <h2><span># </span>Laravel 9</h2>
            <p>As you may know, Laravel transitioned to yearly releases with the release of Laravel 8. Previously, major versions were released
                 every 6 months. This transition is intended to ease the maintenance burden on the community and challenge our development team
                 to ship amazing, powerful new features without introducing breaking changes. Therefore, we have shipped a variety of robust 
                 features to Laravel 8 without breaking backwards compatibility, such as parallel testing support, improved Breeze starter kits,
                 HTTP client improvements, and even new Eloquent relationship types such as "has one of many".

            <h2><span># </span>Meet Laravel</h2>
            <p>
                Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point 
                for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.
            </p>
            <p>
                Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, 
                an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll 
                help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't 
                wait to see what you build.
            </p>
            <h2><span># </span>Why Laravel?</h2>
            <p>
                There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is 
                the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">A Scalable Framework</h3>
            <p>
                Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, 
                distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been 
                easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.
            </p>
            <h2><span># </span>Your First Laravel Project</h2>
            <p>
                Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you 
                are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew. In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer <span class="code">create-project</span> command: <br>
                <code>
                    composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command: <br>
                <code>
                    php artisan serve
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at 
                <span class="code">http://localhost:8000</span>. Next, you're ready to start taking your next steps into the Laravel ecosystem. Of course, 
                you may also want to configure a database.

            <h2><span>#</span> Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                When using any tool in the "real world", you feel more confident if you understand how that tool works. Application development 
                is no different. When you understand how your development tools function, you feel more comfortable and confident using them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this document is to give you a good, high-level overview of how the Laravel framework works. By getting to know the 
                overall framework better, everything feels less "magical" and you will be more confident building your applications. If you 
                don't understand all of the terms right away, don't lose heart! Just try to get a basic grasp of what is going on, and your 
                knowledge will grow as you explore other sections of the documentation.
            </p>
            <h2><span># </span>Lifecycle Overview</h2>
                <ul class="list-info">
                    <li>
                        <h3><span># </span>First Step</h3>
                        <p>
                            The entry point for all requests to a Laravel application is the <span class="code">public/index.php</span> file. 
                            All requests are directed to this file by your web server (Apache / Nginx) configuration. The <span class="code">index.php</span> 
                            file doesn't contain much code. Rather, it is a starting point for loading the rest of the framework.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <span class="code">index.php</span> file loads the Composer generated autoloader definition, and then retrieves an instance of the 
                            Laravel application from <span class="code">bootstrap/app.php</span>. The first action taken by Laravel itself is to create an instance 
                            of the application / service container.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span># </span>HTTP / Console Kernels</h3>
                        <p>
                            Next, the incoming request is sent to either the HTTP kernel or the console kernel, depending on the type of request that is 
                            entering the application. These two kernels serve as the central location that all requests flow through. For now, let's just 
                            focus on the HTTP kernel, which is located in <span class="code">app/Http/Kernel.php</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The HTTP kernel extends the <span class="code">Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel</span> class, which defines an array of 
                            bootstrappers that will be run before the request is executed. These bootstrappers configure error handling, 
                            configure logging, detect the application environment, and perform other tasks that need to be done before the 
                            request is actually handled. Typically, these classes handle internal Laravel configuration that you do not need 
                            to worry about.
                        </p>

            <h2><span># </span>CSRF Protection</h2>
            <p>
                Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit whereby unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an 
                authenticated user. Thankfully, Laravel makes it easy to protect your application from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) 
                attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case you're not familiar with cross-site request forgeries, let's discuss an example of how this vulnerability can be 
                exploited. Imagine your application has a <span class="code">/user/email</span> route that accepts a <span>POST</span> request to change the 
                authenticated user's email address. Most likely, this route expects an <span class="code">email</span> input field to contain the email 
                address the user would like to begin using.
            </p>
            <code>
                form action="https://your-application.com/user/email" method="POST"
                    input type="email" value="malicious-email@example.com"
                /form
                script
                    document.forms[0].submit();
                script
            </code>
            <h2><span># </span>Preventing CSRF Request</h2>
            <p>
                Laravel automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each active user session managed by the application. This token is used to 
                verify that the authenticated user is the person actually making the requests to the application. Since this token is stored in 
                the user's session and changes each time the session is regenerated, a malicious application is unable to access it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current session's CSRF token can be accessed via the request's session or via the <span class="code">csrf_token</span> helper function:
            </p>
            <code>
                use Illuminate\Http\Request;
 
                Route::get('/token', function (Request $request) {
                    $token = $request->session()->token();
 
                    $token = csrf_token();
 
                // ...
                });
            </code>

            <h2><span># </span>Artisan Console</h2>
            <p>
                Artisan is the command line interface included with Laravel. Artisan exists at the root of your application as the <span class="code">artisan</span> 
                script and provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application. To view a <span class="code">list</span> of all 
                available Artisan commands, you may use the list command:
            </p>
            <code>
                php artisan list
            </code>
            <p>
                Every command also includes a "help" screen which displays and describes the command's available arguments and options. 
                To view a help screen, precede the name of the command with <span class="code">help</span>:
            </p>
            <code>
                php artisan help migrate
            </code>
            <ul class="list-info">
                <li>
                    <h3><span># </span>Laravel Sail</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you are using Laravel Sail as your local development environment, remember to use the sail command line to invoke 
                        Artisan commands. Sail will execute your Artisan commands within your application's Docker containers:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        ./vendor/bin/sail artisan list
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><span># </span>Tinker</h3>
                    <p>All Laravel applications include Tinker by default. However, you may install Tinker using Composer if you have 
                        previously removed it from your application:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        composer require laravel/tinker
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Tinker allows you to interact with your entire Laravel application on the command line, including your Eloquent 
                        models, jobs, events, and more. To enter the Tinker environment, run the <span class="code">tinker</span> Artisan command:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        php artisan tinker

            <h2><span>#</span> Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Many web applications provide a way for their users to authenticate with the application and "login". Implementing this 
                feature in web applications can be a complex and potentially risky endeavor. For this reason, Laravel strives to give you 
                the tools you need to implement authentication quickly, securely, and easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, Laravel's authentication facilities are made up of "guards" and "providers". Guards define how users are 
                authenticated for each request. For example, Laravel ships with a session guard which maintains state using session 
                storage and cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Providers define how users are retrieved from your persistent storage. Laravel ships with support for retrieving users 
                using Eloquent and the database query builder. However, you are free to define additional providers as needed for your 
                application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your application's authentication configuration file is located at <span class="code">config/auth.php</span>. This file contains several 
                well-documented options for tweaking the behavior of Laravel's authentication services.

            <h2><span># </span>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Almost every modern web application interacts with a database. Laravel makes interacting with databases extremely simple 
                across a variety of supported databases using raw SQL, a fluent query builder, and the Eloquent ORM. Currently, Laravel 
                provides first-party support for five databases:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-data">
                <li><span>MariaDB 10.3+</span></li>

                <li><span>PostgreSQL 10.0+</span></li>
                <li><span>SQLite 3.8.8+</span></li>

            <header>Eloquent ORM</header>
            <h2><span># </span>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. 
                When using Eloquent, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to 
                retrieving records from the database table, Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as 
                well.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Testing">
            <header>Testing</header>
            <h2><span># </span>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Laravel is built with testing in mind. In fact, support for testing with PHPUnit is included out of the box and a <span class="code">phpunit.xml</span> 
                file is already set up for your application. The framework also ships with convenient helper methods that allow you to 
                expressively test your applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, your application's tests directory contains two directories: Feature and Unit. Unit tests are tests that focus on a 
                very small, isolated portion of your code. In fact, most unit tests probably focus on a single method. Tests within your "Unit" 
                test directory do not boot your Laravel application and therefore are unable to access your application's database or other 
                framework services.
